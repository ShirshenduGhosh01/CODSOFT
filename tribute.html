                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Subhas Chandra Bose was a brilliant student and a nationalist from a young age. He was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and joined the Indian National Congress, quickly rising through the ranks. Dissatisfied with the Congress's approach, he later formed the Forward Bloc.</p>
                        <p>During World War II, Bose sought help from the Axis powers to free India. He led the Indian National Army (INA) and fought alongside Japanese forces against the British. Despite his controversial methods, his determination and sacrifice made him a revered figure in Indian history.</p>
                        <p>Bose is believed to have died in a plane crash on August 18, 1945, though some details of his death remain a subject of speculation and mystery.</p>
